# StackQueue
A Java implemenation of stack and queue that shares the same array element. 

One array with a default size of 100 is used to store two distinct data structures, BOTH a queue and a stack.
The implementation supports: 
• A function that pushes an integer into the stack.
• A function that pops an integer from the stack.
• A function that enqueues an integer into the queue.
• A function that dequeues an integer from the queue.
